## Part 1: OpenCV Basics

### Lesson 1: Changing Image's Color Profiles
Code demonstrating how to change an image's color profiles to grayscale and HSV.

### Lesson 2: Edge Detection
Introduction to edge detection using the Canny algorithm, erosion, and dilation.

### Lesson 3: Image Manipulation
Demonstration of image denoising using the fastNlMeansDenoisingColored function.

### Lesson 4: Drawing Shapes and Writing Text on Images
Code illustrating how to draw shapes and write text on images using OpenCV.

## Part 2: Intermediate Exercises

### Lesson 1: Color Detection
Exercises on color detection in images using different color ranges.

### Lesson 2: Face Detection
Implementation of face detection using the Haarcascade classifier.

### Lesson 3: Shape Detection
Code for detecting shapes like triangles, hexagons, circles, and squares in images.

## Part 3: Projects

### Project 1: Tracking a Ball
A project demonstrating ball tracking in a video using color detection and contour analysis.

### Project 2: Face Recognition
A project implementing face recognition using the face_recognition library. Includes encoding profiles and recognition on unknown faces.
